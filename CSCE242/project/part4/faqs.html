                    <h3>What is the Weather be like in Seattle?</h3>
                    <img src="images/seattle5.lnk" alt="Screenshot of weather in Seattle">
                    <p>Seattle, known for its temperate marine climate, experiences mild and wet winters contrasted by relatively dry and mild summers. 
                        Spring brings a mix of rain and increasing warmth, with temperatures gradually rising from the mid-50s to the mid-60s°F. Summer offers the best weather, with dry conditions and temperatures ranging from the upper 60s to mid-70s°F, perfect for outdoor activities. Rainfall is a defining feature of Seattle's climate, especially from late fall through early spring, contributing to its lush green landscapes and the nickname "The Emerald City." Despite its reputation for rain, Seattle receives less annual precipitation than many other U.S. cities, 
                        with the rain often coming in the form of light drizzles that contribute to its vibrant outdoor culture and scenic beauty.</p>

                    <h3>When the best time of day tours the space needle? </h3>
                    <img src="images/space-needle1.lnk" alt="Screenshot of Seattle space needle">
                    <p>The optimal time for touring the Space Needle is at sunset, offering visitors a mesmerizing view as the sun sets behind the Olympic Mountains, 
                        illuminating the city and Puget Sound with vibrant colors. This time provides unparalleled photographic opportunities and a magical viewing experience, although it's popular and can be crowded. For those seeking tranquility and equally stunning views, early morning visits are advisable, benefiting from fewer crowds and the clear visibility that often accompanies the start of the day. Regardless of the chosen time, 
                        it's recommended to check the weather for clear days and purchase tickets in advance to enhance the experience..</p>
